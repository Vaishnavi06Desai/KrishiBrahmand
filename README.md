There is an absence of an application that connects consumers with farmers in a transparent and direct manner. Hence, we decided to build an application connecting farmers with consumers facilitating the chain of buying and selling. It removes the middlemen from the process, making the process more unambiguous. This also helps in increased profits for the farmer and reduced prices for end users.
